        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat the Oil: In a deep pot over medium-high heat, add the coconut
            oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in the Onions and Tomatoes: Grind some sea salt and ground black
            pepper over the mixture and stir together. Lower heat to medium and
            allow to cook down until juices of the tomatoes are naturally
            released and onions are soft, about 10 minutes. I’ve found that this
            step really helps to develop the flavors of the dish and break them
            all down for the seasonings later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in the Chickpeas: Also mix in the garlic, garam masala, curry
            powder and cumin. Stir to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in the Coconut Milk and Stir Again: Add in the coconut flour (or
            any flour, optional) which helps to slightly thicken the curry.
            Bring the curry to a boil, and then reduce to medium-low so that the
            mixture continues to simmer for 10 to 12 more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve and Enjoy: Taste the curry and season with salt and pepper if
            you desire. Remove the curry from the heat and squeeze a lime
            lightly over the top of the curry, stirring to combine. Don’t skip
            this step!! Allow to cool slightly and then serve. Enjoy!
